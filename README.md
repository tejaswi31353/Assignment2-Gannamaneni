##### Cleveland

Reason : Cleveland, officially the City of Cleveland, is a major city in the U.S. state of **Ohio**, and the county seat of **Cuyahoga County**. It is located along the southern shore of **Lake Erie**, across the U.S. maritime border with Canada and approximately 60 miles west of the **Ohio-Pennsylvania** state border. Thats the main reason i like that place.
